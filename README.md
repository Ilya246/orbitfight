# orbitfight
A very in-development game where you're a spaceship shooting other spaceships in a very large solar system, other mechanics might possibly be added later
Currently you have to join a server to play the game, singleplayer is not available

This game is more of a learning project than a real game and is not really intended to be particularly interesting, another side effect of which is that the code may be rather cursed in places (example: main.cpp#404)

# Hosting
`orbitfight.exe --headless`

# Config
Config documentation should generate upon starting the executable if a config file is not detected

# Compiling
To compile orbitfight, you have to:
- make sure `src/*.cpp` is accounted for
- make sure `include/*.hpp` is accounted for
- make sure SFML `graphics`, `window`, `network` and `system` modules are accounted for
- make sure you're using at least C++20

# Font
Using Hack font, not owned by us
