# orbitfight
A very in-development game where you're a spaceship shooting other spaceships in a very large solar system, other mechanics might possibly be added later
Currently you have to join a server to play the game, singleplayer is not available
This game is more of a learning project than a real game and is not really intended to be particularly interesting
